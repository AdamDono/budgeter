# PaceDebt: Finalizing Financial Freedom for South Africa 🦁🇿🇦

## 1. Executive Summary
**PaceDebt** is a specialized financial management ecosystem designed specifically for the South African market. While global apps like Mint or YNAB focus on US/EU banking, PaceDebt addresses the unique local challenges of **High Interest Debt**, **SARS Tax Compliance (Freelance/Side-Hustle)**, and **Local Cost of Living** (Fuel, Utilities, Load-Shedding costs).

---

## 2. The Problem
1.  **Debt Trap**: South Africans hold roughly R2 trillion in household debt. Most lack the tools to visualize the impact of interest rates.
2.  **Tax Complexity**: The gig economy is booming in SA, but tracking deductible expenses for SARS at year-end is a manual, error-prone nightmare.
3.  **App Gap**: International apps don't support ZAR nuances or local tax regulations, and local banking apps are transaction-focused, not strategy-focused.

## 3. The Solution (PaceDebt)
*   **Strategic Debt Crushing**: Built-in Snowball and Avalanche algorithms help users visualize exactly when they will be debt-free.
*   **SARS-Ready Tracking**: A dedicated module for logging business/freelance deductions, generating a "Tax-Free Savings" projection.

*   **South African Logic**: Built with ZAR as the base currency and localized categories (Petrol, Rent/Bond, Load-Shedding expenses).
